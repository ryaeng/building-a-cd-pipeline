# Building a CD Pipline Using Kubernetes

Within this repo, I'm using Terraform, Linode's LKE, and helm in order to build a CD pipeline that's hosted on Kubernetes. I've included screenshots below. Screenshots are also links for your convenience.

Though this is simplate at the moment, it's not finished. More to follow.
